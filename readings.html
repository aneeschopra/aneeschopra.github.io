      <h3>"As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush</h3>
      <p>The reading suggests that scientific inventions should be focused on enhancing the powers of the human mind rather than our bodies. The focus should be on accessing knowledge rather than leisure activities and ways in which we can use our
        bodies. However, in my opinion, I believe that improving</p>

      <p>Are the first essential elements to develop before attempting to enhance something as complex as the human mind. That can only be achieved after solving the problems associated with human efficiency in order to live a long and fulfilling life.
        When the human race is mentally balanced, then we can achieve the extended research needed to enhance the mind.</p>

      <h3> "Ways of Seeing" by John Berger </h3>
      <p>
        The two aspects of the series that struck out to me the most were:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Sense of worth</li>
        <li>Female nudes</li>
      </ol>
      <h5> 1. Sense of worth </h5>
      <p> Most original paintings have been copied, recreated, and shared around the world. Which interferes with the "value" of the painting.

        It is devalued as the shock factor/ impressiveness scale decreases because it is no longer ne of a kind. However the original is still highly valued, it still loses the power it would have had - if one were to take away the other replicable
        factors.
      </p>
      <p> <i> â€œThis market value depends on it being genuine." </i> </p>
      <br>
      <h5> 2. Female nudity </h5>
      <p>The image of a nude woman becomes a symbol of vanity.
        because of media like this, women see themselves in an unrealistic, yet artistic light.
        The discussion that stood out to me was the woman who doesn't see herself as she is, naked, when looking in the mirror, but instead sees a nude.
